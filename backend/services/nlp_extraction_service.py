        Your task is to analyze user messages about their trip and extract relevant details into a structured JSON format.

        Extract the following information when available:
        - City and country (if mentioned)
        - Travel dates (start_date, end_date in YYYY-MM-DD format, or duration_days)
        - Budget (single value in CAD)
        - Interests: Classify into EXACTLY these 5 categories (use only these names):
          * "Food and Beverage" — restaurants, cafes, food tours, breweries, wine, street food, dining, etc.
          * "Entertainment" — shopping, casino, spa, bar, pub, arcade, nightlife, cinema, concerts, zoo, aquarium, etc.
          * "Culture and History" — museums, libraries, churches, castles, fortresses, old quarters, monuments, art galleries, sightseeing, etc.
          * "Sport" — soccer, basketball, NFL, NBA, stadium, golf, tennis, skiing, cycling, swimming, etc.
          * "Natural Place" — national parks, beaches, lakes, fishing, diving, trekking, hiking, mountains, gardens, waterfalls, etc.
          Only include categories the user actually mentions or implies. Return as an array of category names.
        - Pace of travel (relaxed, moderate, packed). Synonyms: relax/chill/slow/leisurely/easy → "relaxed", balanced/normal/steady → "moderate", fast/rush/busy/intense/active → "packed"
        - Location preference for drop-off or stay (e.g., "downtown", "near nature", "historic district")
        - Booking type: "accommodation" (Airbnb only), "transportation" (flight/bus only), "both" (accommodation + transportation), or "none" (user doesn't want to book anything - if they say "no", "nothing", "I don't need", etc.)
        - Source location: Where user is traveling from (only ask if booking_type is "transportation" or "both")

        Rules:
        1. Only extract information explicitly mentioned or strongly implied
        2. Use null for missing information - do not guess or make assumptions
        3. For dates:
           - Specific dates: Convert to YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "March 15 2026" → "2026-03-15")
           - Month only: Use format "YYYY-MM" or "Month YYYY" (e.g., "November" → "November 2026", "July 2026" → "2026-07")
           - Season: Store as "season YYYY" (e.g., "winter" → "winter 2026", "summer 2024" → "summer 2024")
           - Flexible: If user says "flexible", "anytime", "not sure yet" → set start_date to "flexible"
           - Duration: Extract number of days/weeks (e.g., "5 days" → duration_days: 5, "2 weeks" → duration_days: 14)
        4. For budget, extract a single value (if a range is given, use the midpoint or maximum)
        5. For interests, classify into the 5 categories listed above. Return only the matching category names, not the raw activities
        6. For booking_type: If user responds with "no", "nothing", "I don't need", "no thanks", "I'll book myself", or any negative response → set booking_type to "none"
        7. Be conservative - better to leave something null than to guess incorrectly

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. PRESERVE ALL EXISTING VALUES that are not explicitly updated by the new information
2. If the user provides ONLY a country, keep the existing city value - do NOT set city to null
3. If the user provides ONLY a city, keep the existing country value - do NOT set country to null
4. If the user says "anywhere", "no preference", "flexible", "anywhere is fine", "anywhere is okay" for location → set location_preference to "flexible"
5. If the user says "no", "nothing", "I don't need", "no thanks", "I'll book myself" when asked about booking → set booking_type to "none"
6. Only update fields that are explicitly mentioned or clearly implied in the new input
7. NEVER remove or null out existing values unless the new information directly contradicts them
8. The bot was asking for \"{currently_asking}\" — the user's reply should fill THAT field

Examples:
- Existing: {{"city": "Kingston", "country": null}}, New: "Canada" → Result: {{"city": "Kingston", "country": "Canada"}}
- Existing: {{"city": null, "country": "France"}}, New: "Paris" → Result: {{"city": "Paris", "country": "France"}}
- Existing: {{"city": "Tokyo", "country": "Japan"}}, New: "anywhere is okay" → Result: {{"location_preference": "flexible"}}, keep city and country
- Existing: {{"booking_type": null}}, New: "no" or "nothing" or "I don't need" → Result: {{"booking_type": "none"}}
- Existing: {{"city": "Toronto", "booking_type": "both", "source_location": null}}, New: "Montreal" → Result: keep city as "Toronto", set source_location to "Montreal"
